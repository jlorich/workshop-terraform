Azure Pipelines Releases provides the capability to take the results of a build (i.e. a build artifact) and execute them against multiple stages. In this challenge we'll create a multi-stage release pipeline to continuously deploy our templates to two enviornments.


### Tasks


#### Create a new Release Pipeline

{% collapsible %}
In Azure DevOps, under the Pipelines tab choose Builds. Once selected hit the `+ New` button and choose `New release pipeline`. Pick "start with an empty job"

At this point pick a name for the stage (let's start with "staging").  Also at the top click on "New release piepeline" to change the name.

Once complete click save.

{% end collapsible %}

#### Select a build artifact to start the pipeline

{% collapsible %}

From the pipeline view, click on "Add an artifact".  We want to choose build as the source type, and then select the apporpriate Project and the build pipeline we created in the previous section.  This will ensure we can use the files published in the build as part of our release.

#### Create a task to apply our Terraform templates

From the pipeline view, click on "Add an artifact".  We want to choose build as the source type, and then select the apporpriate Project and the build pipeline we created in the previous section.  This will ensure we can use the files published in the build as part of our release.
