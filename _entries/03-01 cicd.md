Your development team are making an increasing number of modifications to your application code. It is no longer feasible to manually deploy updates.

You are required to create a robust DevOps pipeline supporting CI/CD to deploy code changes.

> **Hint**
> - The source code registries on GitHub contain an `azure-pipelines.yml` definition that you can use with Azure Pipelines to build the containers. This pipeline pushes the images to Docker Hub. **You may need to edit it a bit if you want to do something different, like pushing to Azure Container Registry**. You may also roughly follow the steps inside on your own CI/CD tool such as Jenkins.
> - Make sure you tokenize the Docker image tags in your Kubernetes YAML configuration files instead of using `latest`. You'll need to set those in the build pipeline to the Build ID.
> - You may use the diagram below as guidance.

### Tasks

If you peek into the solutions, they're using Azure DevOps. You may choose doing the same process on Jenkins or another CI/CD tool of your choice.

#### Create an Azure DevOps account

{% collapsible %}

Go to <https://dev.azure.com> and sign-in with your Azure subscription credentials.

If this is your first time to provision an Azure DevOps account, you'll be taken through a quick wizard to create a new organization.

![Getting started with Azure DevOps](media/cicd/getstarted-devops.png)

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Create a project

{% collapsible %}

Create a new private project, call it **azch-captureorder**

![Create Azure DevOps project](media/cicd/createproject.png)

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Fork the source repositories on GitHub or import them to Azure Repos

{% collapsible %}

Click on **Repos** then import the code of the `captureorder` service from the public GitHub repository located at <http://github.com/Azure/azch-captureorder.git>

![Import repository to Azure Repos](media/cicd/0-import-repo.png)

![Import repository to Azure Repos](media/cicd/0.1-import-repo.png)

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Create build pipeline for the application Docker container

{% collapsible %}

Save the YAML below as `azure-pipelines.yml` or download it from [azure-pipelines.captureorder.yml](yaml-solutions/devops/azure-pipelines.captureorder.yml) and store it in your code repository (`azch-captureorder`) as `azure-pipelines.yml`

This simply runs `docker build`, `docker login` and `docker push`, tagging the image with the current `BuildId`.

```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: 'Ubuntu 16.04'

variables:
  imageName: 'captureorder:$(Build.BuildId)'
  # define three more variables acrName, dockerId and dockerPassword in the build pipeline in UI

steps:
- script: docker build -f Dockerfile -t $(acrName).azurecr.io/$(imageName) .
  displayName: 'docker build'

- script: docker login -u $(dockerId) -p $(dockerPassword) $(acrName).azurecr.io
  displayName: 'docker login'

- script: docker push $(acrName).azurecr.io/$(imageName)
  displayName: 'docker push'
```

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Build the code in `azch-captureorder` as a Docker image and push it to the Azure Container Registry you provisioned before

{% collapsible %}

Setup a build using YAML pipelines

![Setup build](media/cicd/2-setup-build.png)

Choose YAML as the pipeline template

![Pipeline Config-As-Code](media/cicd/2-config-as-code.png)

Browse to and select the `azure-pipelines.yml` file you created above. You may also change the agent to be `Hosted Ubuntu`

![Select pipeline config file](media/cicd/2-agent-yaml.png)

Go to the "Variables" tab and create a **Variable group**

![Go to the "Variables" tab](media/cicd/cicd-1.jpg)

Define variables in your build pipeline in the web UI:

- `dockerId`: The admin user name/Service Principal ID for the Azure Container Registry.
- `acrName`: The Azure Container Registry name.
- `dockerPassword`: The admin password/Service Principal password for Azure Container Registry.

![Create variable group](media/cicd/2-variable-group.png)

> **Hint:**
> - Refer to <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-aks#access-with-kubernetes-secret> to obtain the Service Principal ID/Service Principal Password or enable the Azure Container Registry admin user.
> - It would be better if you store those variables as a `Variable Group` instead of a `Pipeline Variable`. This will allow you to reuse them across pipelines.

Run the build pipeline and verify that it works

Verify that the image ends up in your Azure Container Registry

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Create a new Azure DevOps Repo, for example `azch-captureorder-kubernetes` to hold the the YAML configuration for Kubernetes

{% collapsible %}

The reason you're creating a separate repository, is that the Kubernetes deployment configuration is a deployment artifact, which is indepenedent from your code. You may want to change how the container is deployed, which Kubernetes services are created, etc. without triggering a new container build. For this reason, having a seperate repository is the recommended way to go about this, to encourage seperation of concerns. This decouples the application code from where it runs. You build containers in one pipeline but you're not concerned where they would be deployed. You may have multiple other repos and pipelines controlling how you deploy.

Go ahead and create a new repo and call it `azch-captureorder-kubernetes`. Hit the **Initialize** button to create a `README.md` file and add the `.gitignore` file.

![Create a new repo and initialize it](media/cicd/1-create-and-initialize.png)

In the new repository, create a folder `yaml` and add the required YAML files you created before for the service you're building.

![Create YAML folder](media/cicd/1-create-yaml-folder.png)

You may download the YAML files again from the links below. Make sure you store them in the `yaml` folder on the `azch-captureorder-kubernetes` repository.

- [captureorder-deployment.yaml](yaml-solutions/devops/captureorder-deployment.yaml)
- [captureorder-service.yaml](yaml-solutions/devops/captureorder-service.yaml)
- [captureorder-hpa.yaml](yaml-solutions/devops/captureorder-hpa.yaml)

> **Hints**
> - One thing you'll notice is that, in `captureorder-deployment.yaml`, **you'll need to change the image name** `<unique-acr-name>.azurecr.io/captureorder:##BUILD_ID##`. Put in your Azure Container Registry name.
> - Also notice the `##BUILD_ID##`. This is a placeholder that will get replaced further down the line by the release pipeline by the actual version being deployed.

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Create build pipeline for the Kubernetes config files

{% collapsible %}

Save the YAML below as `azure-pipelines.yml` or download it from [azure-pipelines.captureorder-k8s.yml](yaml-solutions/devops/azure-pipelines.captureorder-k8s.yml) and store it in your Kubernetes config repository (`azch-captureorder-kubernetes`) as `azure-pipelines.yml`

This essentially copies the `yaml` folder as a build artifact. The artifact will be picked up by the Release pipeline later on for deployment to the cluster.

```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: 'Ubuntu 16.04'

steps:
- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  displayName: 'publish yaml folder as an artifact'
  inputs:
    artifactName: 'yaml'
    pathToPublish: 'yaml'
```

Similarly to how you setup the Docker images build pipeline, setup a build pipeline using YAML pipelines for `azch-captureorder-kubernetes` repo. Run it once you save and verify you get the `yaml` folder copied as a build artifact.

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Create a continuous deployment pipeline

You'll now create the CD pipeline on the `azch-captureorder-kubernetes` repository that triggers upon **either new container images** or **new YAML configuration artifacts** to deploy the changes to your cluster.

{% collapsible %}

Configure a Service Connection so that Azure DevOps can access resources in your Azure Resource Group for deployment and configuration purposes

![Create Service Connection](media/cicd/3-create-service-connection.png)

Pick the Azure Resource Group you're using

![Pick Azure RG for Service Connection](media/cicd/3-resource-group-service-connection.png)

Create a Release Pipeline, start with an Empty template. Add an **Azure Container Registry** artifact as a trigger and enable the continuous deployment trigger. Make sure to configure it to point to the Azure Container Registry repository where the build pipeline is pushing the `captureorder` image

![ACR artifact trigger](media/cicd/3-artifact.png)

Add another Build artifact coming from the `azch-captureorder-kubernetes` pipeline as a trigger and enable the continuous deployment trigger. This is the trigger for changes in the YAML configuration.
> **Hint** Make sure to pick the *kubernetes* build pipeline and not your main code build pipeline. Also make sure you select *Latest* as the default version

![Build artifact trigger](media/cicd/3-artifact-2.png)

Now, start adding tasks to the default stage. Make sure the agent pool is **Hosted Ubuntu 1604** then add an *inline* **Bash Script** task that will do a token replacement to replace `##BUILD_ID##` in the `captureorder-deployment.yaml` file coming from the with the actual build being released. Remember that `captureorder-deployment.yaml` was published as a build artifact.

You'll want to get the Docker container tag incoming from the Azure Container Registry trigger to replace the `##BUILD_ID##` token. If you named that artifact **_captureorder**, the build number will be in an environment variable called `RELEASE_ARTIFACTS__CAPTUREORDER_BUILDNUMBER`. Similarly for the other artifact **_azch-captureorder-kubernetes**, its build ID would be stored in `RELEASE_ARTIFACTS__AZCH-CAPTUREORDER-KUBERNETES-CI_BUILDID`. You can use the following inline script that uses the `sed` tool.

```sh
sed -i "s/##BUILD_ID##/${RELEASE_ARTIFACTS__CAPTUREORDER_BUILDNUMBER}/g" "$SYSTEM_ARTIFACTSDIRECTORY/_azch-captureorder-kubernetes-CI/yaml/captureorder-deployment.yaml"
```

![Bash task](media/cicd/3-bash-task.png)

Add a **Deploy to Kubernetes** task. Configure access to your AKS cluster using the service connection created earlier.

Scroll down and check **Use configuration files** and use the following value `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_azch-captureorder-kubernetes-CI/yaml/captureorder-deployment.yaml` or select it from the browse button.

![Kubernetes task](media/cicd/3-kubernetes-task-browse.png)

> **Hint** Do the same for `captureorder-service.yaml` and `captureorder-hpa.yaml`. You can right click on the Kubernetes task and clone it.

Once you're done, you should have the tasks looking like the following.

![Kubernetes task](media/cicd/3-kubernetes-task.png)

Create a manual release and pick the latest build as the source. Verify the release runs and that the `captureorder` service is deployed

![Create a release](media/cicd/3-create-release.png)

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Verify everything works

{% collapsible %}

1. Make a change to the application source code, commit the change and watch the pipelines build and release the new version.

1. Make a change to the configuration (for example, change the number of replicas), commit the change and watch the pipelines update your configuration.

![CI/CD release in progress](media/cicd/4-cicd-release.png)

```sh
kubectl get pods
