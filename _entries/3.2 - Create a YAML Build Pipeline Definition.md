title: Create a YAML Build Pipeline Definition
parent-id: challenge2
---

Builds within Azure DevOps are defined with [YAML](https://yaml.org/) files that specify each step.


### Tasks


#### Create an initial azure-pipelines.yml

This file should include steps to run `terraform fmt` and verify that your file is valid.  We don't want to apply any files that are not formatted properly.

{% collapsible %}

Create a new file named `azure-pipelines.yml` along side your code with the following contents:

```
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-16.04'

steps:
- script: terraform fmt -check=true
```

Note: The Ubuntu image

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Copy the validated template files to a build artifact
Every build in Azure Pipelines has the opportunity to publish a set of files that become permanently associated with that build and can be used in future stages (e.g. our release pipeline).  In our case we need to copy the Terraform templates from our directory into the Artifact Staging Directory and then publish these artifacts.

{% collapsible %}

Add the following to the bottom of your azure-pipelines.yml file

```
- script: cp ./* $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory) -R

- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
```

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Create a continuous integration trigger
Within our Azure Pipeline YAML configuration, we can define specify triggers that will cause our build to automatically run.  Add a trigger to automatically run this build every time the `master` branch changes.

{% collapsible %}

Just under where `pool` is specified in `azure-pipelines.yml`, add the following:
```
trigger:
- master
```

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Commit and push the changes


{% collapsible %}


```
git add .
git commit -m "Add CI pipeline definition"
git push origin master
```

{% endcollapsible %}
