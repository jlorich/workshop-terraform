title: Push your template to Azure Repos
parent-id: challenge2

Azure Pipelines is a service for implementing continuos integration and deployment. Our first challenge will be to create a Pipeline which validates a Terraform template, as this will be the first step in our CI/CD process.

### Tasks

#### Create a project in Azure DevOps

{% collapsible %}

Go to [https://dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com), sign in, and create a new project to work in for this challenge.

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Initialize your code folder as a git repository and make your first commit

{% collapsible %}

Initialize the current folder as a git repository:

```sh
git init
```

Add and commit all your files to the git repository

```sh
git add .
git commit -a -m "My first commit"
```

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Add Azure DevOps as a remote repository and push up your code

{% collapsible %}

Within Azure DevOps, a new repository is created with each project.  Click on the Repos tab to focus on the repositories for your project, then from the top right choose the clone button and copy the provided URL.  With that URL in hand, we can now push our source code to the git repository.

Add the Azure DevOps repo as a _remote_ for the repository.

```sh
git remote add origin <The URL that was provided>
```

Push your repo to Azure DevOps.

```sh
git push origin master
```

{% endcollapsible %}
