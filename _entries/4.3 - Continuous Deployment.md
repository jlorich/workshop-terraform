### Tasks

In the Release Pipeline edit view click the lightning bolt on the Artifact at the start of your build. From here, turn on the Continuous Deployment Trigger toggle.  Make sure to save after.

#### Enjoy

Now that we have Continuous Integration and Deployment set up, and changes that we commit and push to our templates in our repo will automatically trigger Builds to validate them, and be rolled out to Staging and Production environments!
