Builds within Azure DevOps are defined with [YAML](https://yaml.org/) files that specify each step.


### Tasks


#### Create and run pipeline in Azure DevOps


{% collapsible %}

In Azure DevOps, under the Pipelines tab choose Builds. Once selected hit the `+ New` button and choose `Create a new build pipeline`.  From here we can choose the repository we want to use, and select the yaml file we created if prompted (if your yaml file was named `azure-pipelines.yml` it should automatically be picked up).

After reviewing your file, click run to save and run the new pipeline.  From here on out all changes pushed to master will trigger this build to run.

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Review the build logs

After hitting run you will see all logs for the given build.  If all is well you should see green checks down the logs.  If anything went wrong, you can click on a step and review details to see what needs to be changed.
