### Tasks


#### Configure the "Environment" variable for our plan

In the Terraform template you created there is a variable called "environment". to leverage this effectively you will need to create a variable within Azure DevOps that differs for each stage in the pipeline.

{% collapsible %}

Under the Release Edit page choose `Variables` from the top menu and click Add.  Name the variable "environment", give it a value of `staging` and set the scope to the "Staging" stage we created earlier.  This will be made available during the Staging stage configuration by using `$(environment)`.

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Modify the Terraform Plan task to accept variables

{% collapsible %}

In our Terraform Plan Task, go back and check "Use Vars".  This will give us a text filed with set of arguments (in json format) that will be passed to terraform when the plan is generated.  Enter the following:

```
{
	"environment": "$(environment)"
}
```

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Release and Verify Resource Creation

Since the created Terraform template defaults specify "dev" as the enviornment, if you save and create a new release you should have a second set of resouces available labeled as "staging".

#### Create a Production stage

{% collapsible %}

From the Pipeline Edit view, mouse over the "Staging" stage and click the Clone button.  Rename this stage to Production.

Under variables you will now also find a duplicated "Environment".  Set the value for this copy to `production` and ensure the Scope is also set to the Production stage.

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Release and Verify Resource Creation

Now that we have Staging and Production Stages created, save the pipeline and create another release.  Once complete you should see Dev, Staging, and Production in your subscription.  As these stages were created with seperate build tasks, we can easily have Production deploy to a seperate subscription entirely.
