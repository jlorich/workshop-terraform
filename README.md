# aksworkshop.io

This is the repository for the AKS Workshop website.

## Technology

- The website is statically built using Jekyll and you’ll find the different pages inside the `_entries` folder.
- If you’re on a Mac/Linux machine, you can preview your edits locally if you run `make build-run` inside the repo root.
- The build pipeline builds Docker images of the site and hosts it as a private repository on Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/u/azch>.
- The release pipeline deploys the Docker image to an Azure Web App.
